  bioText:
    "<p>Even if you have never met Michelle before, you may have seen her work already on celebrities like Russell Brand, Nicole Scherzinger, Elaine Irwin, or Frankie Ballard.  Michelle Marocco has earned international acclaim as a jewelry artist, having been personally invited to Saudi Arabia by the royal family to exhibit the Marocco collection at an annual women-only charity event.  Her one-of-a-kind works of wearable art are in high demand, inspired by meditation and her yoga practice. Although yoga is a strong influence in her work, it is her family which is the deepest root of all of her inspiration and which she puts forst.  Her two sons, Gavin and Justin, always motivate her to design and create.</p><p>Michelle started making jewelry eight years ago. Five years ago, she forged the guiding concept of &ldquo;The Audacity Of Diamonds On Leather&rdquo;. To this day, each of her handcrafted pieces adhere to these conceptual roots, crafted to be a piece of wearable artwork infused with the contemplative energy of the creator.</p><p>Michelle&rsquo;s passion in life is to be in the moment of the creative process, driven to capture and harness that compelling urgency to create works of art that channel positive energy and help rejuvenate the soul.  The Marocco line includes numerous, unique collections born out of her multidimensional imagination: as she describes it, &ldquo;I like to style both the body and spirit with my jewelry.&rdquo;/p><p> Michelle&rsquo;s talents also extend to paintings: she is an accomplished abstract-expressionist and figurative painter with a 15-year career on canvas.   The dialogue braided into her paintings narrates, with layers of textures and symbols, the complex history and influences that shape us.  This theme comes from her reverence for the life principle of Niyama, or purification through self-discipline, a part of the eightfold path of yoga.</p>",

    "<p>Kane Scheidegger is a landscape and ski photographer based in Ridgway and Telluride who combs aspen groves and climbs mountains to capture that perfect, exhilirating moment where Mother Nature shows off her splendor: long-lost waterfalls, the magical hues of Autumnal skies, and the majestic mountains are just a sample of the gems he hunts for in Southwest Colorado and the rest of the world.</p><p>Kane&rsquo;s images stretch across eight foot tall canvases, many of them sweeping panoramas, to immerse the viewer into the moment.</p><p>Winter is one of Kane&rsquo;s favorite seasons because of the variety it brings, from tranquil days in the snow-capped mountains to daring descents down dizzying ski-runs. During the snowy season he photographs everything from extreme skiing to tranquil moments of clearing storms and quiet ski approaches through the wind-carved, sastrugi snow. </p><p>Kane was born and raised in Ridgway, Colorado and earned a Bachelors of Science in graphic arts.  After setting up a graphics company in Southwest Colorado, he pursued his passion of photography.  He is self taught through perseverance and many outings in search of perfect light and composition. Many of his photographs are taken using a  technical camera. He loves the methodical process and tactile workflow of this technique and the stunning quality, crispness, and contrast that this type of camera provides.  He currently uses Phase One's A-Series 100 megapixel camera and for his ski photography, he enjoys the portability and durability of Canon's 5dsr 50 megapixel camera.</p>",

    "<p>Matt Downer's work begs to be touched with its bold allure, hand-crafted contours, and nuanced detail that belies a lifetime of experience and craftsmanship. Ever since he was a kid making sketchy skateboard ramps and catapults, Matt has been fascinated with creating things that work.</p><p>Raised in Manhattan Beach, California, Matt graduated from CSUChico with a Bachelors of Art in Philosophy and Religious Studies.Soon after, he loaded his volkswagen to wander the west and landedin Telluride, Colorado, where he found and honed his skills atSteeprock Joinery. Freed from the cramped cells that Californiaapartments used to quarter him in, he finally was able to stretchout his wood lathe in the vibrant and verdant Rockies. Hiscontemporaries, like Christoph Neander, inspired him withmuseum-quality work to nuture an appreciation of his hand-madepieces by valuing the finest of details and every nuance of closeinspection.</p><p>One of the great pleasures of working with wood is its the richtactility. &ldquo;My hope is that every one of my clients willcaress each piece I&rsquo;ve made for them on a regularbasis,&rdquo; Matt says. &ldquo;By feeling the curves and sensingthe flow of the grain, the piece stands apart from a world full ofobjects spat out by some machine on the other side of the planet.Painstakingly crafted by attentive eyes and practiced hands, everysurface of every piece I make is worked so as to bring life backto the wood that once grew as a beautiful tree.&rdquo;</p><p>Curved pieces with exposed joinery, pegged through-tenons, andartful dovetails compose a theme throughout Matt&rsquo;s designs,rendering each work unique not only to itself but to none otherthan Downer himself. Cherry, Maple and Black Walnut are his mostpopular materials, but any wood with the potential to enhance acustom-made piece may find itself in his hands, as well as metal,glass, stone and inlays of copper and silver.</p>",
